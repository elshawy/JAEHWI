Hello, I'm Jaehwi Kim, a PhD candidate in University of Canterbury. I specialize in geotechnical earthquake engineering and geophysical exploration of the subsurface. My recent research has focused on topics such as geotechnical earthquake engineering, geophysical exploration, and ground motion simulation. I also have an interest in seismic hazard analysis and probabilistic seismic hazard analysis.
